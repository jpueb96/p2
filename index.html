We will be presenting on one of the latest technologies, 3D printing. When most people think about 3D printing, they tend to visualize hard plastic figurines. When thinking about 3D printing in medicine, prosthetics is the first thing that usually comes to mind, but this technology’s capacity is far greater than that.There are various ways 3D printing is being used in medicine, and one of them is printing out tools to use in medical procedures.

iLab / / Haiti is a nonprofit that aims to make sure Haitians have access to medical tools they need. It established a 3D printing lab in Haiti with 2 different printers in which they create the designs for the tools and train individuals to print them. Dara Dotz, the founder of iLab Haiti, ran a pilot study on using 3D printers to create tools for humanitarian relief after the earthquake in 2010. This allowed for immediate access to medical tools without having to worry about delivery delays or transportation. Through this initiative, individuals trained in the lab have been able to create various medical devices and parts. In the pilot study, they fabricated an umbilical cord clamp prototype that’s shown here.Another way 3D printing is used in medicine is for surgical planning purposes.

Surgeons, doctors, and other medical professionals are able to print model organs like hearts for planning purposes. By doing this, they can have physical representations of patient organs before operating, allowing them to reach accurate diagnoses and determine the best treatment. 3D printing could also be beneficial for preoperative planning in the cases of conjoined twins, broken bones, or other procedures along those lines.In medicine, 3D printing does not always have to be done in ordinary materials, there is also bioprinting.

There is a limited availability of donor tissues and organs for transplantation, making bioprinting an important advancement in medicine. Just imagine if a patient needed an organ transplant and the hospital could just print the patient an organ. That seems absolutely mind-blowing, but it could happen in the future. Anthony Atala, from The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, recently published a study introducing an integrated tissue-organ printer, which is otherwise known as ITOP. This printer can produce stable and structured tissue. A potential issue in tissue engineering is a lack of structural support because when the printer is fabricating organs, the organ would need to sustain itself throughout the printing process, meaning that organs cannot be produced in air. Other factors to consider are size, shape, structural integrity, and vascularization of bioprinted constructs. We’re now going to discuss the printing process in the case of creating medical models. The process is slightly different for bioprinting.

The printing process starts with a string of solid material called filament. This line of filament is guided from a reel to the printer’s heated nozzle that melts the material.Once in a melted state, the material follows the predetermined path created by the blueprint on the computer. As the material is extruded, it instantly cools down and solidifies – providing the foundation for the next layer of material until the entire object is manufactured.If the item does not have enough support, a temporary support will be created to ensure accurate dimensions of the item, that is what occurred in the beginning of the video.We now know some of the ways 3D printing is currently being used in the medical field. We can only imagine what the future of 3D printing might look like, but here is what some have already thought could be possible.

The tv show, Westworld takes place in a technologically advanced, Western-themed amusement park populated completely by 3D printed androids dubbed &quot;hosts&quot;. Now, we doubt that any hosts are going to be 3D printed in real life anytime soon, but we can definitely see a future where organs are printed for treatment.
